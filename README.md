HRN-London-WIP

Work in progress HRN London

Hey!

This is what I do right now. :) We are creating a backend for our website.
With this we can upload new speakers to our database and display them on the site.
There are a couple of cool features built in, like you can change the display order of the speakers.
   - You can set the order number of the person when you upload a new one
   - Or, you can just drag the person to the right place on the speaker page
   
This is mostly the backend of the site (that's what I'm doing right now) so the frontend is not here.
If someone wants it, I can commit that too, but otherwise, you can visit the http://london.hrtecheurope.com/ website. :)

Have a nice day visitor and if you have questions or ideas, don't hesitate to share them! :)
